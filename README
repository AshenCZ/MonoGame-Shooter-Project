Hello,
this is a simple game done in Monogame, C#. I supply only source code,
hence the game is not buildable.

I did it for Faculty of Mathematics and Physics on Charles University
in Prague, Czech Republic as a programming project in the second
semester, using Windows, Visual Studio 2013 and Monogame. 

The source code can be found in the /source folder. It is thohroughly
commented and hopefully written in an easy-to-read way. 

Done in Jul 2015, only by me (Stepan Hojdar).
